former chilean dictator gen. augusto pinochet has been arrested by british police on a spanish extradition warrant, despite protests from chile that he is entitled to diplomatic immunity.
about 200 supporters of the retired dictator gathered at the residence of the british ambassador on saturday evening to protest the arrest, some throwing fruit and eggs at the building.
the chilean government immediately demanded his release, arguing that he has diplomatic immunity since he sits in the chilean senate.
castro compared the action with the establishment in rome in august of an international criminal court, a move cuba has expressed reservations about.
