the man accused of directing the bomb attack on the american embassy in kenya came of age in this impoverished indian ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen-agers leave home to enroll in the radical islamic academies of libya, sudan and pakistan.
u.s. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension to provide germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of saudi terrorist suspect osama bin laden, officials said saturday.
nine months before the attack on the american embassy here, u.s. intelligence officials received a detailed warning that islamic radicals were plotting to blow up the building, according to kenyan and american officials.
