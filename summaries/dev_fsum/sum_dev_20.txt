horses belonging to iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to compete in next month's asian games because they failed to meet the requirements of the games veterinary commission, the thai organizers announced thursday.
saudi arabia's top sports official, prince faisal bin fahd, is studying a proposal by the olympic council of asia to at least send a symbolic delegation to the dec. 6-20 games, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
the three horses originally came from iran, but arrived in thailand after a training period in the united states.
