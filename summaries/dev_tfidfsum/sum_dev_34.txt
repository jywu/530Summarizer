demirel consulted turkey's party leaders immediately after ecevit gave up.
it is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence, former premier mesut yilmaz said after talks with demirel.
the leader of the republicans, deniz baykal, urged yilmaz to resign.
turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the return of an islamic-led government.
turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the islamic virtue party out of power.
