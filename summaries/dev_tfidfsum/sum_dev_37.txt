yet microsoft badly trailed netscape in the browser field.
netscape's strategy, gates wrote, was to move the key api into the browser to commoditize the underlying operating system.
the book does chronicle the mistakes made by netscape.
back then, integration was basically bolting a browser onto windows.
this is because internet browsing software had the potential to become an alternative platform to the windows operating system.
so which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws?
later, intel did pull back from its multimedia and internet software development.
the appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate products, bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market.
