1996 : named infrastructure minister in netanyahu government.
ariel sharon's appointment as the israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the middle east peace process, an official syrian newspaper said saturday.
many arabs know sharon for his role in israel's 1982 invasion of lebanon.
since netanyahu has designated sharon as his chief negotiator, the new foreign minister will soon have the opportunity to act more responsibly.
many israeli political observers believe that netanyahu has eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this appointment, signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace agreement.
