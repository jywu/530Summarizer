he asked slepian how performing abortions affected him spiritually.
both kopp and weslin have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests.
so slepian took a step that few of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared.
the clinic is the last in the buffalo area that is performing abortions.
violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem.
but they say kopp's car was seen near slepian's home in amherst, n.y. in the weeks before the doctor was shot.
since his death, doctors from outside buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing abortion services.
