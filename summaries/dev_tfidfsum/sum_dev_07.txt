yilmaz, meanwhile, serves as caretaker premier.
the islamic party, virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
last year, the military ousted turkey's first islamic-led government.
within hours of the government's collapse, virtue leader recai kutan met with president suleyman demirel, who is charged with picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in parliament.
ecevit said he didn't want virtue in the government and reiterated his proposal for a new secular coalition combining his democratic left party with turkey's two center-right parties.
mrs. ciller, head of the center-right true path party and a key contender for power, was meeting with demirel later thursday.
