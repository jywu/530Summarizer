north korea is a mountainous country, with less than 20 percent arable land.
years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of north korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment, u.n. experts said wednesday.
but ngongi said foreign food aid has saved lives.
according to a recent wfp survey, 49 percent of cambodian children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and 20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition.
the koreas were divided into the communist north and the capitalist south in 1945.
they found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition.
