north korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages with its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable illnesses, senior red cross officials said tuesday.
years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of north korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment, u.n. experts said wednesday.
police in northeastern china's jilin province said monday they had rounded up at least 100 north koreans and sent them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country.
among other shocking findings, researchers from the world food program, unicef and the european union found that, because of long-term food shortages, a staggering 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted growth.
