libyan leader moammar gadhafi said the suspects in the lockerbie bombing are very happy to be tried in the netherlands, and he hoped the trial would lead to a better relationship with the united states.
secretary-general kofi annan said wednesday that he is considering a trip to libya next week that could close a deal to try libyan suspects in the pan am lockerbie bombing.
newspapers reported wednesday that three top libyan officials have been tried and jailed in the lockerbie case, but libyan dissidents said the reports appeared to be a political ploy by libya's leader, col. moammar gadhafi.
