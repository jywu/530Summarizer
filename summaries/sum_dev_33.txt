president nelson mandela acknowledged saturday the african national congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of south africa.
the deal that south africa's truth and reconciliation commission offered was simple enough : confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free.
a panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the african national congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster said monday.
torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert for south africa's reconciliation body said thursday.
