forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered.
they were teen-agers whose parents had brought them here from homes torn by war or terror from bosnia, eritrea, somalia and others and in their new country they formed new bonds, through school and music and parties.
how could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second-story windows?
