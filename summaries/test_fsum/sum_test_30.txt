house speaker-elect robert l. livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against president clinton on thursday night as the republican leader was forced to admit to his republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.
rejecting a last-minute democratic attempt to soften its action to censure, the house of representatives moved to impeach president william jefferson clinton for perjury on saturday and to call on the senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.
the raw passions were such that the house democrats did not to hesitate to bellow you resign!
