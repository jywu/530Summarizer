as turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against damascus, egypt on sunday began shuttle democracy between the two neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over turkish kurdish bases in syria.
turkish president suleyman demirel said that turkey was in a position of self-defense and had suffered for many years from damascus sheltering of the autonomy-seeking rebels.
prime minister benjamin netanyahu also stressed israel's hands-off approach to the escalating dispute between damascus and ankara.
sources of tension are being created in our region, government spokesman dimitris reppas said.
