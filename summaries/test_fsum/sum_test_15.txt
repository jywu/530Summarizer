king norodom sihanouk on tuesday praised agreements by cambodia's top two political parties previously bitter rivals to form a coalition government led by strongman hun sen.
king norodom sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of cambodia's top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.
cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency of parliament with its arch foe saturday, insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the legislative body.
disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the cambodian people's party to form a new government.
