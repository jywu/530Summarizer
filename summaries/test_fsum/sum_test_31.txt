endeavour and its astronauts closed in sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the russian-made zarya control module that had to be connected to the unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
washington nasa and the russian space agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to mir, officials announced friday.
endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
flight controllers fired one of the module's two maneuvering engines to raise it to an orbit about 230 kilometers( 157 miles) in space, the station's public affairs office said.
