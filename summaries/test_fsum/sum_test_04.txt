with president fernando henrique cardoso's economic austerity plan at a critical point for brazil, voters went to the polls sunday to elect governors in 12 states and the federal district of brasilia.
the brazilian government, which recently pledged to slash discretionary spending by $ 7 billion in an urgent attempt to boost its economic credibility, has released new budget figures that show the true reduction will run about half the promised amount.
attention has shifted in brazil from the president's almost-certain re-election to gubernatorial runoff elections, on which the success of belt tightening measures deemed necessary to avert an economic meltdown may hinge.
