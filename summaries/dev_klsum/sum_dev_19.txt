though north korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children, said ken davies, the wfp's country director.
the study, the first scientific nutritional survey in north korea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers, who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country.
