washington blames bin laden's group, al qaeda, for the aug. 7 bombings of u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 americans, and injured an estimated 5,000 people.
bin laden, believed to be in afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted wednesday by a u.s. district court in the u.s. embassy bombings in africa and are accused of conspiring to kill americans outside the united states.
the judge made his comments in the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment by a federal grand jury of osama bin laden, who the authorities believe was the mastermind of the embassy attacks.
