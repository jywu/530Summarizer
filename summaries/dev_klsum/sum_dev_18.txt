in brussels, belgium, however, u.s. special envoy richard holbrooke told reporters monday that the situation in kosovo is as bad now as two weeks ago.
on sunday, milosevic met with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and defense minister igor sergeyev, serbian president milan milutinovic and yugoslavia's top defense officials.
to avoid such an attack, yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks, he said.
the united states and russia are ratcheting up the pressure on yugoslav president slobodan milosevic, warning that nato airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action to end the crisis in kosovo province.
