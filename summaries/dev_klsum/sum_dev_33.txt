facing a court challenge, the truth and reconciliation commission said wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate south africa's last apartheid-era president, f.w.
in its report, the commission called the apartheid state the primary perpetrator of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former officials as former president p.w.
former archbishop desmond tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, and would excise de klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying its release.
