beijing police sunday detained one of xu's china democracy party colleagues, zha jianguo, to prevent him from attending the trial, xu's wife said.
also sentenced monday, to 11 years in prison, was wang youcai, 32, founder of the china democracy party, which has now been suppressed.
to allay international criticism, china released a respected labor rights campaigner, liu nianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison camps on sunday and sent him into exile in the united states.
monday's sentences, which came just six months after president clinton's visit to beijing, where he publicly challenged china's leaders to move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the state department.
