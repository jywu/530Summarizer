the obstetrician, dr. barnett slepian, was killed by a sniper on friday night at his home in a buffalo suburb.
in the past four years, three canadian doctors and a doctor in rochester, n.y., all of whom performed abortions, have been wounded by snipers.
in each case, police said a gunman, using a high-powered rifle, fired through a window into the home of the doctors.
susan ward, a spokeswoman for buffalo gyn women's services, the private clinic where slepian performed abortions, said the national abortion federation had faxed a warning to the clinic friday morning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks.
