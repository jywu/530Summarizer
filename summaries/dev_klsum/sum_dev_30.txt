set up in 1993, the u.n. court has convicted three muslims, two bosnian croats and a bosnian serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.
the yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared zejnil delalic, a muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against serb captives at a bosnian government-run prison camp under his command.
hazim delic, a muslim who served as mucic's deputy, was found guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing other inmates.
