in meetings this week in pyongyang, the north korean capital, u.s. officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious underground site, which american intelligence officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the north's nuclear weapons program.
saturday, clinton called that site, together with north korea's test firing in august of a missile over japan, cause for deep concern.
the talks ended as clinton began a trip to asia that will include a visit to south korea, where the issue of the north korean construction site is expected to be among the major topics discussed with president kim dae-jung.
