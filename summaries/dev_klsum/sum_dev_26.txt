turkey wants italy to extradite the rebel, abdullah ocalan, leader of the kurdistan workers party, which is seeking kurdish autonomy in southeastern turkey.
in istanbul, turkish inmates at a prison took an italian prisoner hostage to increase pressure for ocalan's extradition.
earlier monday, while members of d'alema's government met with turkish officials who were in rome for a european ministerial meeting, thousands of kurds flooded into rome to hold a demonstration and hunger strike in support of ocalan.
turkey stepped up pressure on italy for the extradition of captured kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan, saying sunday that granting him asylum would amount to opening doors to terrorism.
