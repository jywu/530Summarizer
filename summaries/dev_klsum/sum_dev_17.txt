anwar, 51, was arrested sept. 20 under the internal security act, which allows indefinite detention without trial, after two weeks of rallies around malaysia at which he called for government reform and prime minister mahathir mohamad's resignation.
on sept. 2, malaysia's prime minister mahathir mohamad fired anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.
jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, ousted deputy prime minister anwar ibrahim is a political underdog in malaysia.
in a court appearance last week, anwar's face was bruised and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international attention to his case.
