iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, official results showed sunday.
the results were expected since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
iran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, a hard-liner, has the final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keep it that way.
khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly by hard-liners loathe to give up control over iran's judiciary, security agencies and other key institutions.
