facing a court challenge, the truth and reconciliation commission said wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate south africa's last apartheid-era president, f.w. de klerk, in illegal acts.
it seems that nearly all of south africa's political parties including the ruling african national congress have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report.
during the talks, the white national party government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the anc refused.
former archbishop desmond tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, and would excise de klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying its release.
