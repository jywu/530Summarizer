tripoli, libya( ap) u.n. secretary-general kofi annan arrived in libya saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two libyan suspects in the 1988 pan am bombing over lockerbie, scotland.
the meeting with gadhafi took place after libya's official news agency, jana, reported that annan might not be able to meet with the libyan leader because gadhafi was in the desert.
the u.n. security council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a flight ban, to try to force libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed 270 people.
