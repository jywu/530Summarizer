by one vote, a defector from its own ranks, premier romano prodi's center-left coalition, italy's second-longest serving government since world war ii, lost a confidence vote friday in the chamber of deputies.
prodi's far-left ally, the communist refoundation party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key to italy's participation in the european common currency.
president oscar luigi scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.
