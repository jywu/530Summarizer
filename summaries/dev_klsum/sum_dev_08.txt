typhoon babs headed toward southern china friday after battering the central and northern philippines with heavy winds and rain that killed at least 82 people, flattened crops, and drove more than 100,000 people from their homes.
typhoon babs brought torrential rains and landslides to taiwan and lashed hong kong with strong winds sunday after killing more than 150 people in the philippines and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
philippine weather forecasters said sunday they were monitoring a low pressure area over the pacific, about 900 kilometers-lrb- 558 miles-rrb- east of the southern philippine island of mindanao, that could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.
