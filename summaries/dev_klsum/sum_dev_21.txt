this new software, which now will be combined with netscape's online store services, will be available for companies to use both on america online and on the internet.
it would strengthen two of microsoft's leading rivals, aol and sun microsystems.
even before the netscape deal, america online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services.
and at present aol uses microsoft's web browser, internet explorer, as the service's default choice.
aol, according to executives close to the proposed deal, will own netscape, but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with sun.
