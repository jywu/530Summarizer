habibie of indonesia and philippine president joseph estrada consider anwar a friend, and estrada won't say whether he plans to attend this year's apec summit.
the agenda might be global, but the menu will be malaysian when world leaders meet next week for the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum.
the trial will be interrupted during the nov. 12-18 apec meetings, but mahathir's treatment of anwar and his reform movement already have been criticized by apec members such as australia, indonesia, the philippines and the united states.
