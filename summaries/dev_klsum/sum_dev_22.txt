endeavour and its astronauts closed in sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the russian-made zarya control module that had to be connected to the unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
on their 12-day flight, endeavour's astronauts are to locate a russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new u.s. module.
once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.
