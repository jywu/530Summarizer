sharon's appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the( peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks, said tishrin, which often speaks for the syrian government.
prime minister benjamin netanyahu named sharon foreign minister on friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating israel's final borders with the palestinians.
last week sharon told an israeli newspaper that, negotiations or not, he would never shake the hand of yasser arafat, the palestinian leader, whom he has long disdained.
an israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of palestinian refugees by christian lebanese militiamen at two beirut camps.
