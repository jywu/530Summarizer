in a decision welcomed as a landmark by portugal, european union leaders saturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of east timor, the former portuguese colony occupied by indonesia since 1975.
representatives of exiled east timorese pro-independence groups said friday that indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed southeast asian territory, killing one east timorese and wounding 22 others.
indonesia on tuesday denied claims that its troops massacred more than 40 east timorese recently, and criticized portugal for suspending u.n.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory.
