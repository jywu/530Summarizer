chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped foreigners tuesday near a remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern russia.
a foreign office minister said monday that the british phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
no ransom demands have been made for the hostages, said an embassy spokeswoman, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
the gruesome killings heightened alarm and outrage about the volatile situation in the region, which spun out of moscow's control long ago.
