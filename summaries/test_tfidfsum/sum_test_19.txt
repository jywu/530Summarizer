kabila has turned kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern congo.
congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust president laurent kabila to the internet.
on saturday, the rebels shot down a congolese boeing 727 over the kindu airport.
the rebels have targeted kindu since late august, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of kinshasa after angola and zimbabwe sent troops to bail out kabila.
on sunday, a spokesman in goma boasted that kindu was already under rebel control.
tanks, aircraft and troops from angola, zimbabwe and namibia are supporting kabila.
