seven years ago, indonesian troops fired on pro-independence protesters in dili, the east timor capital.
east timorese opponents of indonesia's rule claimed sunday that some 2,000 indonesian troops supported by helicopters launched an attack on the rebels.
the united nations does not recognize indonesian rule and is sponsoring peace talks between indonesia and portugal, the former colonial master.
portugal and east timorese pro-independence groups rejected that proposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory to decide its future.
it annexed the territory, 1,200 miles-lrb- 1,900 kilometers-rrb- east of jakarta, a month later.
