a respiratory infection forced him to cut short a trip to central asia earlier this week.
yakushkin, his spokesman, reiterated tuesday there was no talk about an early resignation.
there is no reason for rocking the boat and demanding anyone's resignation, primakov said, according to the interfax news agency.
aides said the president's condition was satisfactory.
the president has been suffering from bronchitis and a cold this week, which forced him to cut short a visit to central asia on monday.
