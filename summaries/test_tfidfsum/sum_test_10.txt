for most croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit was saturday's beatification of the controversial world war ii cardinal, alojzije stepinac.
stepinac is a national hero to millions of roman catholic croats, and to croatia's nationalist president, franjo tudjman.
roman catholics hail stepinac as a martyr, but many serbs and jews accuse him of sympathizing with the nazis.
pope pius xii later made him a cardinal.
declaring him a martyr of the faith, pope john paul ii on saturday honored croatia's world war ii cardinal, a hero to roman catholics, but long a symbol of divisions in the balkans.
