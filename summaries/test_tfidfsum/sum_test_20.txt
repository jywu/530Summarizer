palestinian security sources and the families of the dead bombers had already identified them as islamic jihad activists.
the radical group islamic jihad claimed responsibility saturday for the suicide bombing of a crowded jerusalem market and promised more attacks to try to block the new peace accord.
the militant palestinian movement islamic holy war said saturday that it carried out the suicide bombing in a jerusalem market on friday, which prompted arrests by the palestinian authority overnight.
in response to the attack, the israeli cabinet suspended ratification of the wye agreement until there is verification that the palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism.
