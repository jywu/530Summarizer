all of these satellites came through tuesday's meteor shower unscathed.
showers of leonid meteors may produce hundreds or thousands of blazing meteors each hour.
but nowhere did the reported rate of meteor sightings greatly exceed 2,000 per hour barely one-tenth the rate at which meteors hit the atmosphere during the great 1966 leonid storm.
the scientists who track temple-tuttle do not even call it a shower, they call it a meteor storm.
if tuesday's storm seriously damages any satellites, the effects could be even more daunting.
some satellites in low-earth orbits can actually hide from meteoroid storms, ozkul said.
