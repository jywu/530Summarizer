turkish officials claim that ocalan is currently hiding in russia.
the group has been fighting for kurdish autonomy in turkey since 1984.
the turkish army claims it all but wiped out the pkk within turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in iran, syria, and iraq and the fighting continues.
turkey and syria stuck the deal tuesday, ending a weeks-long standoff.
turkish officials had insisted that talks with syria cover only the question of support for kurdish insurgents.
under the deal, syria agreed to brand the kurdish workers party, or pkk, a terrorist group and to clamp down its activity in syria.
