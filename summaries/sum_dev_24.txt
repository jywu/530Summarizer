ariel sharon's appointment as the israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the middle east peace process, an official syrian newspaper said saturday.
a senior palestinian negotiator says the success of a peace summit this week near washington depends on a clear-cut yes from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to an american initiative.
ariel sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer.
in beirut, lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a disaster for peace.
but for more than three decades his role in israeli public life has been that of an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in the bare-knuckled combat of domestic partisan politics.
