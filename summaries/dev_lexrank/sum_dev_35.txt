investigators said kopp's car was seen near the amherst, n.y., home of dr. barnett slepian in the weeks before the doctor, whose work at an abortion clinic had long made him a target of harassment, was killed.
while many including mrs. hayes disavow violent tactics, supporters of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors.
the justice department says that a federal task force set up this week to investigate the killing of slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion violence at various clinics.
