the arrests of xu and qin at their homes monday night and the accusations against them and wang were the sharpest action chinese leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally register the china democracy party in june.
the sudden arrest on monday night of xu, as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form the china democratic party, set off strong protests from human rights groups, other chinese dissidents and washington.
last week the chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers of the china democracy party, one of whom, wang youcai, is to go on trial dec. 17.
