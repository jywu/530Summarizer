though north korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children, said ken davies, the wfp's country director.
years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of north korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment, u.n. experts said wednesday.
now that aid groups say they are starting to get somewhat better cooperation from the north koreans, they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months.
