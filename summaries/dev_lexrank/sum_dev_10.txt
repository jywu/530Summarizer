khatami went on national television late saturday to criticize the selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has the power to appoint or dismiss iran's supreme leader.
the results were expected since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
by eliminating the moderates for friday's assembly election, the conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stinging defeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30 million people voted for khatami against a hard-line rival.
