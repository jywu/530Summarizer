endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.

the space shuttle endeavor is to follow on dec. 3 with the second station part, a u.s.-built connecting passageway that attaches to the first module.
