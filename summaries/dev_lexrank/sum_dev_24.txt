prime minister benjamin netanyahu named sharon foreign minister on friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating israel's final borders with the palestinians.
the independent an-nahar newspaper quoted lebanese prime minister rafik hariri as saying : sharon's appointment makes lebanon and most world states ask : does the israeli government really want peace as it is trying to delude the world?
ariel sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be israel's next foreign minister, said in an interview published sunday that if he gets the job, he won't shake the hand of palestinian leader yasser arafat.
