on sept. 2, malaysia's prime minister mahathir mohamad fired anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.
most pro-anwar sites also contain his speeches, private letters to mahathir, clippings of foreign news reports and prose scorching the 72-year old prime minister.
local newspapers that are normally pro-mahathir have splashed close-up photos of anwar's badly bruised face for two days.

he was asked to sign it and he did.
almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption here.
