north korea has demanded that the united states pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to inspect a huge underground center that u.s. intelligence analysts fear houses a nuclear-weapons program, clinton administration officials said wednesday.
in his speech, clinton pointed to recent north korean missile tests, incursions into the south and a mysterious underground site that may be a nuclear weapons installation as signs of the potential threat.
the u.s. delegation, led by charles kartman, president clinton's special envoy on north korean issues, left pyongyang on wednesday after 12 hours of negotiations over three days with a team from the north korean foreign ministry.
