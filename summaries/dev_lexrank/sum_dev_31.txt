a leader of italy's hard-line marxist faction, known as the communist refounding party, resigned monday in protest over his party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil prodi's slender majority in parliament.
it is autumn in italy, the birds are going south, and so it seems could the italian government, as the bonds of compromise and political opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government came undone sunday.
the communist refoundation party provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget.
