turkey stepped up the pressure on italy for the extradition of captured kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan, warning sunday that granting him asylum would amount to opening doors to terrorism.
he leads the outlawed kurdistan workers party, pkk, which has been fighting for kurdish autonomy in southeastern turkey since 1984.
in rome, spokesmen for the pkk said ocalan had carefully selected italy because he felt there was sympathy there for his cause.
a kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in rome of its founder and leader.
