in the antitrust suit, the government asserts that the america online deal shows how microsoft used the power of its windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against netscape.
the talk about that line at the microsoft-netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating system the platform, in computer terms and the application programs, sometimes called solutions, that run on top of the operating system.
part of the government's evidence in the intel-microsoft episode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by steven mcgeady, an intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written by him on aug. 28, 1995.
