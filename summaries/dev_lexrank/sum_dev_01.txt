president clinton expressed sympathy to israel friday after a car-bomb explosion in a jerusalem market wounded 24 people but said the attack should not derail the recent land-for-security deal between israel and the palestinians.
we must work together, israelis and palestinians, to confront these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process, arafat said after the attack on the market, which was swarming with shoppers readying for the jewish sabbath.
the palestinian cabinet also condemned the attack following their meeting friday night but added that israel should not use it as an excuse to halt the peace process.
