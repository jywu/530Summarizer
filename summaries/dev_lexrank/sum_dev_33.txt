indeed, news reports monday said the truth commission would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that the anc and the more radical pan africanist congress were conducting a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state.
drawing from the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims, the report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white governments for the vast majority.
the commission's report is supposed to be a broad and detailed summary of south africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when elections open to all races ended white minority rule.
