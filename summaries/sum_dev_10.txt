iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, official results showed sunday.
thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators rallied in a tehran park sunday to protest the rejection of scores of candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.
fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a key election friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urged iranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the 19-year-old islamic regime.
the results came as no surprise since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
