in lisbon, jamsheed marker, the u.n. envoy for east timor, said late thursday that portugal and indonesia are mulling a new united nations proposal that envisages broad autonomy for east timor.
meanwhile, military officials said an indonesian soldier was killed early friday in manufahi, about 40 kilometers-lrb- 25 miles-rrb- southeast of dili, east timor capital.
indonesia annexed east timor in 1976, a year after its troops intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of portuguese rule.
indonesia's national commission on human rights will investigate accusations that soldiers executed as many as 50 people this month in the troubled province of east timor in a military operation against armed rebels, the government said tuesday.
