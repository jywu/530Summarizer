although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said carlsson.
the newspaper expressen reported sunday that police were told just hours after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injured claimed to know who set the fire.
the fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the dance took place, was rented by the local macedonian immigrant association in sweden's second-largest city.
officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including somalis, ethiopians, iraqis, iranians and swedes, as well as people from the current and former yugoslavia and unspecified latin american countries.
