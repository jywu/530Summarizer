foreign minister amr moussa, who accompanied mubarak to saudi arabia and syria, said mubarak had consulted by phone on saturday with assad and also conveyed a message to turkish president suleyman demirel through turkey's ambassador to egypt, yasser yakis.
the turkish government, which sent about 10,000 soldiers into northern iraq to attack kurdish rebels, has said it might send forces into syria to eradicate guerrilla bases there, according to news reports.
for its part, syria has accused turkey of forming military alliances with israel that threaten arab security and undermine syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the jewish state.
