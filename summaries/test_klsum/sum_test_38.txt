doctors ordered russian president boris yeltsin to cut short his central asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.
( yeltsin) was affected by a difficult flight and the end of a difficult week, yeltsin's chief spokesman, dmitry yakushkin, told a news conference.
yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever he gets sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to function.
