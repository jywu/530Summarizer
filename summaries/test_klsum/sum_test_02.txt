hundreds of thousands of pieces of swissair flight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now been retrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the sept. 2 crash remains far off, investigators said tuesday.
in halifax, nova scotia, a spokesman for canada's transportation safety board, jim harris, said that some of the blankets had been recovered but that they showed no fire damage.
swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video-on-demand system, connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit, after canadian investigators detected signs of heat damage on wiring and other debris from the ceiling around the cockpit of the md-11.
