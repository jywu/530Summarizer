if afghanistan does turn over bin laden to saudi arabia, it is possible that bin laden might be tried there, rather than in the united states.
bin laden, the saudi-born islamic militant who lives in afghanistan, has long been suspected of involvement in that and other attacks on americans, including the aug. 7 bombings of two u.s. embassies in africa.
but el hage was familiar with several of the arab immigrants associated with alkifah center, say prosecutors and the account that abouhalima provided investigators.
the judge made his comments in the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment by a federal grand jury of osama bin laden, who the authorities believe was the mastermind of the embassy attacks.
