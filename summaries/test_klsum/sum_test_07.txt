earlier this week, israel threatened to close down the gaza airport when palestinian airport workers refused to allow israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the palestinian authority.
throughout the morning, arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes from egypt, morocco, jordan, spain, the european union and two palestinian airlines flights.
taking a major step toward statehood, the palestinians on tuesday inaugurated gaza international airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.
