but primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on the imf loan, not the other way around.
or as primakov put it thursday, without the fund's money, russia will have to impose unpopular measures.
imf officials have said they want the russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the installment is given, and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable.
what makes this year's imf meeting most remarkable, though, is that the harshest criticisms are directed at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the u.s. treasury, which is viewed as the power behind the imf.
