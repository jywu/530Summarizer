trying to put the best face on the results, speaker newt gingrich said in marietta, ga., that the republicans still held onto the house for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932.
republicans were discussing possible challenges to gingrich, his second-in-command, rep. dick armey, and other members of the senior leadership team.
the democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and it whittled the republican house majority down to a mere six votes.
