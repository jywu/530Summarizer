bob livingston, the incoming speaker of the house, took no public role friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach president clinton.
remember that everyone in washington, including rep. henry hyde, r-ill., chairman of the judiciary committee, said the house would never, ever, treat impeachment as a partisan issue.
republicans, indeed livingston himself, had made this same distinction between clinton's sexual indiscretions and livingston's, saying that clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused the legal system and his powers.
you've set before us an example, the leader of house republican majority, rep. dick armey of texas, told livingston saturday.
