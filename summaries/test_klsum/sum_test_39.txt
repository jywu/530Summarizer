parliament on thursday formally elected gen. emile lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor syria, as lebanon's next president.
prime minister rafik hariri has declined an informal invitation from lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on nov. 24, the day president elias hrawi leaves office.
but many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming support to hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president to select a prime minister.
