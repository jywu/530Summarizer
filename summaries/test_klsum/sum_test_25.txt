the two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel business post naiad, about 100 kilometers( 60 miles) off the new south wales state town of merimbula, according to the australian search and rescue coordination center( aussar) in canberra.
although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by german maxi morning glory in 1996.
