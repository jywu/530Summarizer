with $ 30 billion having drained from federal reserves since russia's economic collapse in late august, and the sao paulo stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the brazilian government has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach of elections.
with 22 percent of the vote counted, cardoso appeared to have won 51 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for his main rival, luiz inacio lula da silva, the three-time presidential candidate of the leftist workers party.
even without announcing harsh budget cutting measures, the situation still looks fairly grim for cardoso allies in brazil's four most developed states sao paulo, rio de janeiro, minas gerais and rio grande do sul.
