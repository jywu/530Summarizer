the islamic militant group hamas, which has tried to stop the peace agreement, claimed responsibility, police said.
most recently, israel's cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing friday in jerusalem that killed the two assailants and injured 21 israelis.
a palestinian security official said several islamic holy war members were arrested in the west bank on friday night.
the palestinians, however, said the two bombers had come from israeli-controlled areas and that israel thus bore at least part of the security responsibility for the attack.
