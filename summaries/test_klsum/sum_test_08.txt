turkey officially asked russia last week to extradite ocalan, who leads the banned kurdish workers party, or pkk, which has been fighting for kurdish autonomy in turkey since 1984.
russia's parliament on wednesday asked president boris yeltsin to offer political asylum to kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan, who is wanted in turkey on charges of heading a terrorist organization.
abdullah ocalan was arrested after stepping off a plane from moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in syria, turkish and italian officials said friday.
the turkish army claims it all but wiped out the pkk within turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in iran, syria, and iraq and the fighting continues.
