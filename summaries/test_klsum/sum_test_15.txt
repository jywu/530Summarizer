last week, hun sen's cambodian people's party and ranariddh's funcinpec party agreed to form a coalition that would leave hun sen as sole prime minister and make the prince president of the national assembly.
opposition leaders prince norodom ranariddh and sam rainsy, citing hun sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not negotiate freely in cambodia and called for talks at sihanouk's residence in beijing.
hun sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in july's national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government on its own.
