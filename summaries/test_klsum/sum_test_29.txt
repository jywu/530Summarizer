earlier this week, israel threatened to close down the gaza airport when palestinian airport workers refused to allow israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the palestinian authority.
the airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by u.s. president bill clinton at wye river, maryland in october, was hailed by palestinians as a milestone toward independence and statehood.
throughout the morning, arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes from egypt, morocco, jordan, spain, the european union and two palestinian airlines flights.
