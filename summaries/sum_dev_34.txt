bulent ecevit, who was asked to form a new government wednesday, is a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home.
the chances for a new, strictly secular government in turkey faded wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the islamic party a share of power.
opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions wednesday against prime minister mesut yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster.
deniz baykal, leader of the center-left republican party whose backing in parliament helps yilmaz's minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately.
