russian president boris yeltsin cut short a trip to central asia on monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead russia through a sustained economic crisis.
hours after he returned to work, the generally pro-yeltsin upper house of parliament fell just 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down over his social welfare policies.
the motion carries no legal weight, but it reflects growing anti-yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that has generally supported him.
even if had passed, the move would have had no legal consequences, but it highlighted growing anti-yeltsin sentiments in the chamber made up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have been loyal to the president.
