endeavour and its astronauts closed in sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the russian-made zarya control module that had to be connected to the unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
yuri koptev, head of the russian space agency, said the launching of zarya, a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion in the early stages of station construction, was a needed vindication for the troubled russian space program.
the russian khrunichev company has earned over dlrs 200 million for building zarya, whose design was based on earlier soviet spacecraft, including some of the mir's six modules.
