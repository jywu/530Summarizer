ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere in the kurdish regions that stretch over parts of turkey, iraq, iran and syria.
turkey had demanded that syria cease all support for the guerrilla force known as the kurdistan workers party, or pkk, which is fighting for a kurdish homeland in southeastern turkey.
the syrians have always said that they don't support the pkk and that ocalan is not there, a diplomat said.
russia's foreign ministry last month condemned the turkish government's raids against kurdish rebels in iraq and demanded that turkey withdraw its troops.
