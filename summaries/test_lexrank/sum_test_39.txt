lahoud had been expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking hariri to form the next government after the president polled members of the 128-seat parliament on their choice for prime minister.
parliament on thursday formally elected gen. emile lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor syria, as lebanon's next president.
prime minister rafik hariri has declined an informal invitation from lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
under a formula aimed at preventing the recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in lebanon is shared equally by a maronite christian president, a sunni muslim prime minister and a shiite parliament speaker.
