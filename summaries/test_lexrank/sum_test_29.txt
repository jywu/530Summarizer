earlier this week, israel threatened to close down the gaza airport when palestinian airport workers refused to allow israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the palestinian authority.
tomer degani, a spokesman for the israeli military government in gaza, said periodic security closures, which bar palestinians from entering israel, would not effect the operation of the airport.
palestinian officials said that palestinian leader yasser arafat and his entourage were aboard the plane in question, and that exempted the plane from israeli security checks.
