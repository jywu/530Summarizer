police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick two-story building just before midnight thursday and turned a boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments.
lasse gustafsson, a former goteborg firefighter severely disfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try to show the victims relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.
per-olof ortarsen of goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks.
