by the time the earth collides with a dense swarm of meteoroids tuesday night to unleash what may be the heaviest meteor bombardment since 1966, many orbiting satellites will have maneuvered into positions facing away from the storm to avoid damage.
some satellites in low-earth orbits can actually hide from meteoroid storms, ozkul said.
rowe said the only previous instance of a satellite's being disabled by meteors occurred in 1993 during a shower about one-3,000 th the density of the storm predicted for tuesday.
while people around the world watched the beginning of the best meteor storm light show in three decades, the u.s. national aeronautics and space administration and private satellite companies rotated their high-tech machinery to face away from the approaching debris.
