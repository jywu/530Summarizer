but by paying such homage to cardinal alojzije stepinac, who was imprisoned by the tito government as a nazi collaborator, the pope also stepped into one of the most divisive serbian-croatian disputes in all of former yugoslavia.
in 1994, when the pope made his first papal visit to croatia, the country was still in the throes of a war started when croatia broke away from yugoslavia in 1991 and lost a third of its territory to serbs.
before a huge crowd spread over several muddy hillsides overlooking croatia's main shrine to the virgin mary, john paul beatified cardinal alojzije stepinac, elevating him to the last step before possible sainthood.
