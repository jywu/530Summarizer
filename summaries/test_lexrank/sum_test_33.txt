arafat adviser ahmed tibi said on israeli television that the invitation for a clinton visit came from israel and was warmly welcomed by the palestinians.
less than a week before u.s. president bill clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new israeli-palestinian peace accord, the two sides exchanged angry accusations sunday over jewish settlements and street clashes.
clinton's visit to israel and the palestinian lands, which is to begin saturday, is meant to provide impetus to the u.s.-brokered peace accords and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for compliance.
