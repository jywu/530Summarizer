hundreds of thousands of pieces of swissair flight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now been retrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the sept. 2 crash remains far off, investigators said tuesday.
a spokeswoman for the airline, jackie pash, stressed that investigators had not determined what role, if any, the system played in the crash.
the plane crashed on sept. 2, on a flight from kennedy international airport in new york to switzerland, killing all 229 people aboard.
benoit bouchard, chairman of canada's transportation safety board, predicted it would take longer than the normal 12 months to complete a final report on the crash off the nova scotia coast that killed all 229 people aboard the new york-to-geneva flight.
