the arrests of xu and qin at their homes monday night and the accusations against them and wang were the sharpest action chinese leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally register the china democracy party in june.
the sudden arrest on monday night of xu, as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form the china democratic party, set off strong protests from human rights groups, other chinese dissidents and washington.
since dissidents began organizing and trying to legally register the china democracy party, police have harassed and briefly detained more than two dozen members, but until now the government had not leveled such politically charged allegations.
