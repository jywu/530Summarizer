with president fernando henrique cardoso's economic austerity plan at a critical point for brazil, voters went to the polls sunday to elect governors in 12 states and the federal district of brasilia.
the budget projected 4 percent economic expansion for 1999, just after brazil had doubled the ceiling on interest rates to almost 50 percent, to counter a $ 1 billion a day flight of dollar reserves from the country after the russian collapse.
sen. pedro piva, of the president's brazilian social democracy party, called sunday's elections a warning sign for the government, adding, i think we're going to have difficulties ahead to approve this package.
