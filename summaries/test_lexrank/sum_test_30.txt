house speaker-elect robert l. livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against president clinton on thursday night as the republican leader was forced to admit to his republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.
who, who among us has not sinned?
but the voices of reason would not be heard.
in the end, the will of the people meant nothing.
to soak up some of that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt.
it was just a more hideous version of the mclaughlin group.
the right was on the march and democracy was on the run.
