the rebels targeted kindu since late august, when they were forced to retreat their march from extreme western congo to the outskirts of kinshasa after angola and zimbabwe sent troops to bail out kabila.
on saturday, the rebels said they shot down a congolese boeing 727 which was attempting to land at kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition.
apart from kindu, ngangura said rebel fighters took buta, 120 kilometers( 75 miles) north of kisangani and on the main road in northern congo that links sudan and the central african republic.
