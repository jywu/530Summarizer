brazilian voters gave president fernando henrique cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of balloting sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
the united states also was pushing to get the imf and other donors behind a rescue for brazil of perhaps dlrs 30 billion, which could be announced soon after sunday's presidential elections there.
gilberto manuel da silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said that he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personally but that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize brazil's economy.
